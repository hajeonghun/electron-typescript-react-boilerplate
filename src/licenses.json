New components will be added regularly over the coming months._\n\n- [Transition](#transition)\n- [Menu Button (Dropdown)](#menu-button-dropdown)\n- [Listbox (Select)](#listbox)\n- [Switch (Toggle)](#switch-toggle)\n\n### Roadmap\n\nThis project is still in early development, but the plan is to build out all of the primitives we need to provide interactive React examples of all of the components included in [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com), the commercial component directory that helps us fund the development of our open-source work like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).\n\nThis includes things like:\n\n- Modals\n- Tabs\n- Slide-overs\n- Mobile menus\n- Accordions\n\n...and more in the future.\n\nWe'll be continuing to develop new components on an on-going basis, with a goal of reaching a pretty fleshed out v1.0 by the end of the year.\n\n---\n\n## Transition\n\n[View live demo on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/headlessuireact-menu-example-b6xje?file=/src/App.js)\n\nThe `Transition` component lets you add enter/leave transitions to conditionally rendered elements, using CSS classes to control the actual transition styles in the different stages of the transition.\n\n- [Basic example](#basic-example)\n- [Showing and hiding content](#showing-and-hiding-content)\n- [Animating transitions](#animating-transitions)\n- [Co-ordinating multiple transitions](#co-ordinating-multiple-transitions)\n- [Transitioning on initial mount](#transitioning-on-initial-mount)\n- [Component API](#component-api)\n\n### Basic example\n\nThe `Transition` accepts a `show` prop that controls whether the children should be shown or hidden, and a set of lifecycle props (like `enterFrom`, and `leaveTo`) that let you add CSS classes at specific phases of a transition.\n\n```tsx\nimport { Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>Toggle</button>\n      <Transition\n        show={isOpen}\n        enter=\"transition-opacity duration-75\"\n        enterFrom=\"opacity-0\"\n        enterTo=\"opacity-100\"\n        leave=\"transition-opacity duration-150\"\n        leaveFrom=\"opacity-100\"\n        leaveTo=\"opacity-0\"\n      >\n        I will fade in and out\n      </Transition>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Showing and hiding content\n\nWrap the content that should be conditionally rendered in a `<Transition>` component, and use the `show` prop to control whether the content should be visible or hidden.\n\n```tsx\nimport { Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>Toggle</button>\n      <Transition\n        show={isOpen}\n        // ...\n      >\n        I will fade in and out\n      </Transition>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `Transition` component will render a `div` by default, but you can use the `as` prop to render a different element instead if needed. Any other HTML attributes (like `className`) can be added directly to the `Transition` the same way they would be to regular elements.\n\n```tsx\nimport { Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>Toggle</button>\n      <Transition\n        show={isOpen}\n        as=\"a\"\n        href=\"/my-url\"\n        className=\"font-bold\"\n        // ...\n      >\n        I will fade in and out\n      </Transition>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you'd prefer not to render an additional element at all, you can pass your children as a function instead which will receive a `ref` that you need to attach to your root node:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>Toggle</button>\n      <Transition\n        show={isOpen}\n        // ...\n      >\n        {ref => <div ref={ref}>{/* Your content goes here*/}</div>}\n      </Transition>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nBe sure to attach the `ref` or your transitions will not work correctly.\n\n### Animating transitions\n\nBy default, a `Transition` will enter and leave instantly, which is probably not what you're looking for if you're using this library.\n\nTo animate your enter/leave transitions, add classes that provide the styling for each phase of the transitions using these props:\n\n- **enter**: Applied the entire time an element is entering. Usually you define your duration and what properties you want to transition here, for example `transition-opacity duration-75`.\n- **enterFrom**: The starting point to enter from, for example `opacity-0` if something should fade in.\n- **enterTo**: The ending point to enter to, for example `opacity-100` after fading in.\n- **leave**: Applied the entire time an element is leaving. Usually you define your duration and what properties you want to transition here, for example `transition-opacity duration-75`.\n- **leaveFrom**: The starting point to leave from, for example `opacity-100` if something should fade out.\n- **leaveTo**: The ending point to leave to, for example `opacity-0` after fading out.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>Toggle</button>\n      <Transition\n        show={isOpen}\n        enter=\"transition-opacity duration-75\"\n        enterFrom=\"opacity-0\"\n        enterTo=\"opacity-100\"\n        leave=\"transition-opacity duration-150\"\n        leaveFrom=\"opacity-100\"\n        leaveTo=\"opacity-0\"\n      >\n        I will fade in and out\n      </Transition>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the transitioning element will take 75ms to enter (that's the `duration-75` class), and will transition the opacity property during that time (that's `transition-opacity`).\n\nIt will start completely transparent before entering (that's `opacity-0` in the `enterFrom` phase), and fade in to completely opaque (`opacity-100`) when finished (that's the `enterTo` phase).\n\nWhen the element is being removed (the `leave` phase), it will transition the opacity property, and spend 150ms doing it (`transition-opacity duration-150`).\n\nIt will start as completely opaque (the `opacity-100` in the `leaveFrom` phase), and finish as completely transparent (the `opacity-0` in the `leaveTo` phase).\n\nAll of these props are optional, and will default to just an empty string.\n\n### Co-ordinating multiple transitions\n\nSometimes you need to transition multiple elements with different animations but all based on the same state. For example, say the user clicks a button to open a sidebar that slides over the screen, and you also need to fade-in a background overlay at the same time.\n\nYou can do this by wrapping the related elements with a parent `Transition` component, and wrapping each child that needs its own transition styles with a `Transition.Child` component, which will automatically communicate with the parent `Transition` and inherit the parent's `show` state.\n\n```tsx\nimport { Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction Sidebar({ isOpen }) {\n  return (\n    <Transition show={isOpen}>\n      {/* Background overlay */}\n      <Transition.Child\n        enter=\"transition-opacity ease-linear duration-300\"\n        enterFrom=\"opacity-0\"\n        enterTo=\"opacity-100\"\n        leave=\"transition-opacity ease-linear duration-300\"\n        leaveFrom=\"opacity-100\"\n        leaveTo=\"opacity-0\"\n      >\n        {/* ... */}\n      </Transition.Child>\n\n      {/* Sliding sidebar */}\n      <Transition.Child\n        enter=\"transition ease-in-out duration-300 transform\"\n        enterFrom=\"-translate-x-full\"\n        enterTo=\"translate-x-0\"\n        leave=\"transition ease-in-out duration-300 transform\"\n        leaveFrom=\"translate-x-0\"\n        leaveTo=\"-translate-x-full\"\n      >\n        {/* ... */}\n      </Transition.Child>\n    </Transition>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `Transition.Child` component has the exact same API as the `Transition` component, but with no `show` prop, since the `show` value is controlled by the parent.\n\nParent `Transition` components will always automatically wait for all children to finish transitioning before unmounting, so you don't need to manage any of that timing yourself.\n\n### Transitioning on initial mount\n\nIf you want an element to transition the very first time it's rendered, set the `appear` prop to `true`.\n\nThis is useful if you want something to transition in on initial page load, or when its parent is conditionally rendered.\n\n```tsx\nimport { Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyComponent({ isShowing }) {\n  return (\n    <Transition\n      appear={true}\n      show={isShowing}\n      enter=\"transition-opacity duration-75\"\n      enterFrom=\"opacity-0\"\n      enterTo=\"opacity-100\"\n      leave=\"transition-opacity duration-150\"\n      leaveFrom=\"opacity-100\"\n      leaveTo=\"opacity-0\"\n    >\n      {/* Your content goes here*/}\n    </Transition>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Component API\n\n#### Transition\n\n```jsx\n<Transition\n  appear={true}\n  show={isOpen}\n  enter=\"transition-opacity duration-75\"\n  enterFrom=\"opacity-0\"\n  enterTo=\"opacity-100\"\n  leave=\"transition-opacity duration-150\"\n  leaveFrom=\"opacity-100\"\n  leaveTo=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  {/* Your content goes here*/}\n</Transition>\n```\n\n##### Props\n\n| Prop        | Type                                  | Description

CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/headlessuireact-menu-example-b6xje?file=/src/App.js)\n\nThe `Menu` component and related child components are used to quickly build custom dropdown components that are fully accessible out of the box, including correct ARIA attribute management and robust keyboard navigation support.\n\n- [Basic example](#basic-example-1)\n- [Styling the active item](#styling-the-active-item)\n- [Showing/hiding the menu](#showinghiding-the-menu)\n- [Disabling an item](#disabling-an-item)\n- [Transitions](#transitions)\n- [Rendering additional content](#rendering-additional-content)\n- [Rendering a different element for a component](#rendering-a-different-element-for-a-component)\n- [Component API](#component-api-1)\n\n### Basic example\n\nMenu Buttons are built using the `Menu`, `Menu.Button`, `Menu.Items`, and `Menu.Item` components.\n\nThe `Menu.Button` will automatically open/close the `Menu.Items` when clicked, and when the menu is open, the list of items receives focus and is automatically navigable via the keyboard.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Menu } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyDropdown() {\n  return (\n    <Menu>\n      <Menu.Button>More</Menu.Button>\n      <Menu.Items>\n        <Menu.Item>\n          {({ active }) => (\n            <a className={`${active && 'bg-blue-500'}`} href=\"/account-settings\">\n              Account settings\n            </a>\n          )}\n        </Menu.Item>\n        <Menu.Item>\n          {({ active }) => (\n            <a className={`${active && 'bg-blue-500'}`} href=\"/account-settings\">\n              Documentation\n            </a>\n          )}\n        </Menu.Item>\n        <Menu.Item disabled>\n          <span className=\"opacity-75\">Invite a friend (coming soon!)</span>\n        </Menu.Item>\n      </Menu.Items>\n    </Menu>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Styling the active item\n\nThis is a headless component so there are no styles included by default. Instead, the components expose useful information via [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) that you can use to apply the styles you'd like to apply yourself.\n\nTo style the active `Menu.Item` you can read the `active` render prop argument, which tells you whether or not that menu item is the item that is currently focused via the mouse or keyboard.\n\nYou can use this state to conditionally apply whatever active/focus styles you like, for instance a blue background like is typical in most operating systems.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Menu } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyDropdown() {\n  return (\n    <Menu>\n      <Menu.Button>More</Menu.Button>\n      <Menu.Items>\n        {/* Use the `active` state to conditionally style the active item. */}\n        <Menu.Item>\n          {({ active }) => (\n            <a\n              className={`${active ? 'bg-blue-500 text-white' : 'bg-white text-black'}`}\n              href=\"/account-settings\"\n            >\n              Account settings\n            </a>\n          )}\n        </Menu.Item>\n        {/* ... */}\n      </Menu.Items>\n    </Menu>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Showing/hiding the menu\n\nBy default, your `Menu.Items` instance will be shown/hidden automatically based on the internal `open` state tracked within the `Menu` component itself.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Menu } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyDropdown() {\n  return (\n    <Menu>\n      <Menu.Button>More</Menu.Button>\n\n      {/* By default, this will automatically show/hide when the Menu.Button is pressed. */}\n      <Menu.Items>\n        <Menu.Item>{/* ... */}</Menu.Item>\n        {/* ... */}\n      </Menu.Items>\n    </Menu>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you'd rather handle this yourself (perhaps because you need to add an extra wrapper element for one reason or another), you can add a `static` prop to the `Menu.Items` instance to tell it to always render, and inspect the `open` slot prop provided by the `Menu` to control which element is shown/hidden yourself.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Menu } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyDropdown() {\n  return (\n    <Menu>\n      {({ open }) => (\n        <Menu.Button>More</Menu.Button>\n        {open && (\n          <div>\n            {/* Using `static`, `Menu.Items` is always rendered and ignores the `open` state. */}\n            <Menu.Items static>\n              <Menu.Item>{/* ... */}</Menu.Item>\n              {/* ... */}\n            </Menu.Items>\n          </div>\n        )}\n      )}\n    </Menu>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Disabling an item\n\nUse the `disabled` prop to disable a `Menu.Item`. This will make it unselectable via keyboard navigation, and it will be skipped when pressing the up/down arrows.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Menu } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyDropdown() {\n  return (\n    <Menu>\n      <Menu.Button>More</Menu.Button>\n      <Menu.Items>\n        {/* ... */}\n\n        {/* This item will be skipped by keyboard navigation. */}\n        <Menu.Item disabled>\n          <span className=\"opacity-75\">Invite a friend (coming soon!)</span>\n        </Menu.Item>\n\n        {/* ... */}\n      </Menu.Items>\n    </Menu>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Transitions\n\nTo animate the opening/closing of the menu panel, use the provided `Transition` component. All you need to do is mark your `Menu.Items` as `static`, wrap it in a `<Transition>`, and the transition will be applied automatically.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Menu, Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyDropdown() {\n  return (\n    <Menu>\n      {({ open }) => (\n        <>\n          <Menu.Button>More</Menu.Button>\n\n          {/* Use the Transition + open render prop argument to add transitions. */}\n          <Transition\n            show={open}\n            enter=\"transition duration-100 ease-out\"\n            enterFrom=\"transform scale-95 opacity-0\"\n            enterTo=\"transform scale-100 opacity-100\"\n            leave=\"transition duration-75 ease-out\"\n            leaveFrom=\"transform scale-100 opacity-100\"\n            leaveTo=\"transform scale-95 opacity-0\"\n          >\n            <Menu.Items static>\n              <Menu.Item>{/* ... */}</Menu.Item>\n              {/* ... */}\n            </Menu.Items>\n          </Transition>\n        </>\n      )}\n    </Menu>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Rendering additional content\n\nThe `Menu` component is not limited to rendering only its related subcomponents. You can render anything you like within a menu, which gives you complete control over exactly what you are building.\n\nFor example, if you'd like to add a little header section to the menu with some extra information in it, just render an extra `div` with your content in it.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Menu } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyDropdown() {\n  return (\n    <Menu>\n      <Menu.Button>More</Menu.Button>\n      <Menu.Items>\n        <div class=\"px-4 py-3\">\n          <p class=\"text-sm leading-5\">Signed in as</p>\n          <p class=\"text-sm font-medium leading-5 text-gray-900 truncate\">tom@example.com</p>\n        </div>\n        <Menu.Item>\n          {({ active }) => (\n            <a className={`${active && 'bg-blue-500'}`} href=\"/account-settings\">\n              Account settings\n            </a>\n          )}\n        </Menu.Item>\n\n        {/* ... */}\n      </Menu.Items>\n    </Menu>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNote that only `Menu.Item` instances will be navigable via the keyboard.\n\n### Rendering a different element for a component\n\nBy default, the `Menu` and its subcomponents each render a default element that is sensible for that component.\n\nFor example, `Menu.Button` renders a `button` by default, and `Menu.Items` renders a `div`. `Menu` and `Menu.Item` interestingly _do not render an extra element_, and instead render their children directly by default.\n\nThis is easy to change using the `as` prop, which exists on every component.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Menu } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyDropdown() {\n  return (\n    {/* Render a `div` instead of no wrapper element */}\n    <Menu as=\"div\">\n      <Menu.Button>More</Menu.Button>\n      {/* Render a `ul` instead of a `div` */}\n      <Menu.Items as=\"ul\">\n        {/* Render an `li` instead of no wrapper element */}\n        <Menu.Item as=\"li\">\n          {({ active }) => (\n            <a className={`${active && 'bg-blue-500'}`} href=\"/account-settings\">\n              Account settings\n            </a>\n          )}\n        </Menu.Item>\n\n        {/* ... */}\n      </Menu.Items>\n    </Menu>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo tell an element to render its children directly with no wrapper element, use `as={React.Fragment}`.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Menu } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyDropdown() {\n  return (\n    <Menu>\n      {/* Render no wrapper, instead pass in a button manually. */}\n      <Menu.Button as={React.Fragment}>\n        <button>More</button>\n      </Menu.Button>\n      <Menu.Items>\n        <Menu.Item>\n          {({ active }) => (\n            <a className={`${active && 'bg-blue-500'}`} href=\"/account-settings\">\n              Account settings\n            </a>\n          )}\n        </Menu.Item>\n        {/* ... */}\n      </Menu.Items>\n    </Menu>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Component API\n\n#### Menu\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  <Menu.Button>More</Menu.Button>\n  <Menu.Items>\n    <Menu.Item>{/* ... */}</Menu.Item>\n    {/* ... */}\n  </Menu.Items>\n</Menu>\n```\n\n##### Props\n\n| Prop | Type                | Default                                 | Description                                           |\n| ---- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| `as` | String \\| Component | `React.Fragment` _(no wrapper element_) | The element or component the `Menu` should render as. |\n\n##### Render prop object\n\n| Prop   | Type    | Description                      |\n| ------ | ------- | -------------------------------- |\n| `open` | Boolean | Whether or not the menu is open. |\n\n#### Menu.Button\n\n```jsx\n<Menu.Button>\n  {({ open }) => (\n    <>\n      <span>More options</span>\n      <ChevronRightIcon className={`${open ?

Instead, the components expose useful information via [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) that you can use to apply the styles you'd like to apply yourself.\n\nTo style the active `Listbox.Option` you can read the `active` render prop argument, which tells you whether or not that listbox option is the option that is currently focused via the mouse or keyboard.\n\nTo style the selected `Listbox.Option` you can read the `selected` render prop argument, which tells you whether or not that listbox option is the option that is currently the `value` passed to the `Listbox`.\n\n> Note: An option can be both **active** and **selected** at the same time!\n\nYou can use this state to conditionally apply whatever active/focus styles you like, for instance a blue background like is typical in most operating systems. For the selected state, a checkmark is also common.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, Fragment } from 'react'\nimport { Listbox } from '@headlessui/react'\nimport CheckmarkIcon from './CheckmarkIcon'\n\nfunction MyListbox() {\n  const people = [\n    { id: 1, name: 'Durward Reynolds' },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Kenton Towne' },\n    { id: 3, name: 'Therese Wunsch' },\n    { id: 4, name: 'Benedict Kessler' },\n    { id: 5, name: 'Katelyn Rohan' },\n  ]\n  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0])\n\n  return (\n    <Listbox value={selectedPerson} onChange={setSelectedPerson}>\n      <Listbox.Button>{selectedPerson.name}</Listbox.Button>\n      <Listbox.Options>\n        {people.map(person => (\n          {/* Use the `active` state to conditionally style the active option. */}\n          {/* Use the `selected` state to conditionally style the selected option. */}\n          <Listbox.Option as={Fragment} key={person.id} value={person}>\n            {({ active, selected }) => (\n              <li className={`${active ? 'bg-blue-500 text-white' : 'bg-white text-black'}`}>\n                {selected && <CheckmarkIcon />}\n                {person.name}\n              </li>\n            )}\n          </Listbox.Option>\n        ))}\n      </Listbox.Options>\n    </Listbox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Using a custom label\n\nBy default the `Listbox` will use the button contents as the label for screenreaders. However you can also render a custom `Listbox.Label`.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, Fragment } from 'react'\nimport { Listbox } from '@headlessui/react'\nimport CheckmarkIcon from './CheckmarkIcon'\n\nfunction MyListbox() {\n  const people = [\n    { id: 1, name: 'Durward Reynolds' },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Kenton Towne' },\n    { id: 3, name: 'Therese Wunsch' },\n    { id: 4, name: 'Benedict Kessler' },\n    { id: 5, name: 'Katelyn Rohan' },\n  ]\n  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0])\n\n  return (\n    <Listbox value={selectedPerson} onChange={setSelectedPerson}>\n      <Listbox.Label>Assignee:</Listbox.Label>\n      <Listbox.Button>{selectedPerson.name}</Listbox.Button>\n      <Listbox.Options>\n        {people.map(person => (\n          <Listbox.Option as={Fragment} key={person.id} value={person}>\n            {person.name}\n          </Listbox.Option>\n        ))}\n      </Listbox.Options>\n    </Listbox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Showing/hiding the listbox\n\nBy default, your `Listbox.Options` instance will be shown/hidden automatically based on the internal `open` state tracked within the `Listbox` component itself.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, Fragment } from 'react'\nimport { Listbox } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyListbox() {\n  const people = [\n    { id: 1, name: 'Durward Reynolds', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Kenton Towne', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 3, name: 'Therese Wunsch', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 4, name: 'Benedict Kessler', unavailable: true },\n    { id: 5, name: 'Katelyn Rohan', unavailable: false },\n  ]\n  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0])\n\n  return (\n    <Listbox value={selectedPerson} onChange={setSelectedPerson}>\n      <Listbox.Button>{selectedPerson.name}</Listbox.Button>\n\n      {/* By default, this will automatically show/hide when the Listbox.Button is pressed. */}\n      <Listbox.Options>\n        {people.map(person => (\n          <Listbox.Option key={person.id} value={person} disabled={person.unavailable}>\n            {person.name}\n          </Listbox.Option>\n        ))}\n      </Listbox.Options>\n    </Listbox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you'd rather handle this yourself (perhaps because you need to add an extra wrapper element for one reason or another), you can add a `static` prop to the `Listbox.Options` instance to tell it to always render, and inspect the `open` slot prop provided by the `Listbox` to control which element is shown/hidden yourself.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, Fragment } from 'react'\nimport { Listbox } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyListbox() {\n  const people = [\n    { id: 1, name: 'Durward Reynolds', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Kenton Towne', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 3, name: 'Therese Wunsch', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 4, name: 'Benedict Kessler', unavailable: true },\n    { id: 5, name: 'Katelyn Rohan', unavailable: false },\n  ]\n  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0])\n\n  return (\n    <Listbox value={selectedPerson} onChange={setSelectedPerson}>\n      {({ open }) => (\n        <>\n          <Listbox.Button>{selectedPerson.name}</Listbox.Button>\n          {open && (\n            <div>\n              {/* Using `static`, `Listbox.Options` is always rendered and ignores the `open` state. */}\n              <Listbox.Options static>\n                {people.map(person => (\n                  <Listbox.Option key={person.id} value={person} disabled={person.unavailable}>\n                    {person.name}\n                  </Listbox.Option>\n                ))}\n              </Listbox.Options>\n            </div>\n          )}\n        </>\n      )}\n    </Listbox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Disabling an option\n\nUse the `disabled` prop to disable a `Listbox.Option`. This will make it unselectable via keyboard navigation, and it will be skipped when pressing the up/down arrows.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, Fragment } from 'react'\nimport { Listbox } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyListbox() {\n  const people = [\n    { id: 1, name: 'Durward Reynolds', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Kenton Towne', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 3, name: 'Therese Wunsch', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 4, name: 'Benedict Kessler', unavailable: true },\n    { id: 5, name: 'Katelyn Rohan', unavailable: false },\n  ]\n  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0])\n\n  return (\n    <Listbox value={selectedPerson} onChange={setSelectedPerson}>\n      <Listbox.Button>{selectedPerson.name}</Listbox.Button>\n      <Listbox.Options>\n        {people.map(person => (\n          {/* Disabled options will be skipped by keyboard navigation. */}\n          <Listbox.Option key={person.id} value={person} disabled={person.unavailable}>\n            <span className={person.unavailable ? 'opacity-75' : ''}>{person.name}</span>\n          </Listbox.Option>\n        ))}\n      </Listbox.Options>\n    </Listbox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Transitions\n\nTo animate the opening/closing of the listbox panel, use the provided `Transition` component. All you need to do is mark your `Listbox.Options` as `static`, wrap it in a `<Transition>`, and the transition will be applied automatically.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, Fragment } from 'react'\nimport { Listbox, Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyListbox() {\n  const people = [\n    { id: 1, name: 'Durward Reynolds', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Kenton Towne', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 3, name: 'Therese Wunsch', unavailable: false },\n    { id: 4, name: 'Benedict Kessler', unavailable: true },\n    { id: 5, name: 'Katelyn Rohan', unavailable:

</Transition>\n    </Listbox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Rendering a different element for a component\n\nBy default, the `Listbox` and its subcomponents each render a default element that is sensible for that component.\n\nFor example, `Listbox.Label` renders a `label` by default, `Listbox.Button` renders a `button` by default, `Listbox.Options` renders a `ul` and `Listbox.Option` renders a `li` by default. `Listbox` interestingly _does not render an extra element_, and instead renders its children directly by default.\n\nThis is easy to change using the `as` prop, which exists on every component.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, Fragment } from 'react'\nimport { Listbox } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyListbox() {\n  const people = [\n    { id: 1, name: 'Durward Reynolds' },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Kenton Towne' },\n    { id: 3, name: 'Therese Wunsch' },\n    { id: 4, name: 'Benedict Kessler' },\n    { id: 5, name: 'Katelyn Rohan' },\n  ]\n  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0])\n\n  return (\n    <Listbox as=\"div\" value={selectedPerson} onChange={setSelectedPerson}>\n      <Listbox.Button>{selectedPerson.name}</Listbox.Button>\n      <Listbox.Options as=\"div\">\n        {people.map(person => (\n          <Listbox.Option as=\"span\" key={person.id} value={person}>\n            {person.name}\n          </Listbox.Option>\n        ))}\n      </Listbox.Options>\n    </Listbox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo tell an element to render its children directly with no wrapper element, use `as={React.Fragment}`.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, Fragment } from 'react'\nimport { Listbox } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyListbox() {\n  const people = [\n    { id: 1, name: 'Durward Reynolds' },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Kenton Towne' },\n    { id: 3, name: 'Therese Wunsch' },\n    { id: 4, name: 'Benedict Kessler' },\n    { id: 5, name: 'Katelyn Rohan' },\n  ]\n  const [selectedPerson, setSelectedPerson] = useState(people[0])\n\n  return (\n    <Listbox value={selectedPerson} onChange={setSelectedPerson}>\n      <Listbox.Button as={React.Fragment}>{selectedPerson.name}</Listbox.Button>\n      <Listbox.Options>\n        {people.map(person => (\n          <Listbox.Option key={person.id} value={person}>\n            {person.name}\n          </Listbox.Option>\n        ))}\n      </Listbox.Options>\n    </Listbox>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Component API\n\n#### Listbox\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, Fragment } from 'react'\nimport { Listbox } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction MyListbox() {\n  const people = [\n    {

Optionally you can also use the `Switch.Group` and `Switch.Label` components.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { Switch } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction NotificationsToggle() {\n  const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <Switch\n      checked={enabled}\n      onChange={setEnabled}\n      className={`${switchValue ? \"bg-blue-600\" : \"bg-gray-200\"} relative inline-flex h-6 rounded-full w-8`}\n    >\n      <span className=\"sr-only\">Enable notifications</span>\n      <span\n        className={`${enabled ? \"translate-x-4\" : \"translate-x-0\"} inline-block w-4 h-4 transform bg-white rounded-full`}\n      />\n    </Switch>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Using a custom label\n\nBy default the `Switch` will use the contents as the label for screenreaders. If you need more control, you can render a `Switch.Label` outside of the `Switch`, as long as both the switch and label are within a parent `Switch.Group`.\n\nClicking the label will toggle the switch state, like you'd expect from a native checkbox.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { Switch } from '@headlessui/react'\n\nfunction NotificationsToggle() {\n  const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <Switch.Group>\n      <Switch.Label>Enable notifications</Switch.Label>\n      <Switch\n        checked={enabled}\n        onChange={setEnabled}\n        className={`${switchValue ? \"bg-blue-600\" : \"bg-gray-200\"} relative inline-flex h-6 rounded-full w-8`}\n      >\n        <span\n          className={`${enabled ? \"translate-x-4\" : \"translate-x-0\"} inline-block w-4 h-4 transform bg-white rounded-full`}\n        />\n      </Switch>\n    </Switch.Group>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Component API\n\n#### Switch\n\n```jsx\n<Switch checked={checkedState} onChange={setCheckedState}>\n  <span className=\"sr-only\">Enable notifications</span>\n  {/* ... */}\n</Switch>\n```\n\n##### Props\n\n| Prop       | Type                    | Default                                 | Description                                              |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `as`       | String \\| Component     | `button` | The element or component the `Switch` should render as. |\n| `checked`    | Boolean |                              | Whether or not the switch is checked.                                      |\n| `onChange` | `(value: boolean): void`      |                              | The function to call when the switch is toggled.      |\n\n##### Render prop object\n\n| Prop   | Type    | Description                         |\n| ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| `checked` | Boolean | Whether or not the switch is checked. |\n\n\n#### Switch.Label\n\n```jsx\n<Switch.Group>\n  <Switch.Label>Enable notifications</Switch.Label>\n  <Switch checked={enabled} onChange={setEnabled} className=\"...\">\n    {/* ... */}\n  </Switch>\n</Switch.Group>\n```\n\n##### Props\n\n| Prop       | Type                    | Default                                 | Description                                              |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `as`       | String \\| Component     | `label` | The element or component the `Switch.Label` should render as. |\n\n#### Switch.Group\n\n```jsx\n<Switch.Group>\n  <Switch.Label>Enable notifications</Switch.Label>\n  <Switch checked={enabled} onChange={setEnabled} className=\"...\">\n    {/* ... */}\n  </Switch>\n</Switch.Group>\n```\n\n##### Props\n\n| Prop       | Type                    | Default                                 | Description                                              |\n| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `as`       | String \\| Component     | `React.Fragment` _(no wrapper element)_| The element or component the `Switch.Group` should render as. |",

If You\n   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n   as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n   meet the following conditions:\n\n   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n       stating that You changed the files; and\n\n   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n       the Derivative Works; and\n\n   (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

See the [example](http://gabelerner.github.io/canvg/examples/convert.htm).\n\nThere is also a built in extension method to the canvas context to draw svgs similar to the way [drawImage](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#dom-context-2d-drawimage) works:\n```javascript\nvar c = document.getElementById('canvas');\nvar ctx = c.getContext('2d');\nctx.drawSvg(SVG_XML_OR_PATH_TO_SVG, dx, dy, dw, dh);\n```\n\n\n### Related Repositories\n* [canvg](http://gabelerner.github.io/canvg)",

Like an event emitter that only emits a single event type. Really tiny.\n\nI extracted this from Redux's `createStore()` because I found it to be useful in other contexts.

    "repository": "https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js",
    "name": "commander",
    "version": "1.1.1",
    "licenseText": "# Commander.js\n\n  The complete solution for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) command-line interfaces, inspired by Ruby's [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander).\n\n [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js)\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install commander\n\n## Option parsing\n\n Options with commander are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('commander');\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')\n  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')\n  .option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')\n  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('you ordered a pizza with:');\nif (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');\nif (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineappe');\nif (program.bbq) console.log('  - bbq');\nconsole.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);\n```\n\n Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as \"--template-engine\" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.\n\n## Automated --help\n\n The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:\n\n```  \n $ ./examples/pizza --help\n\n   Usage: pizza [options]\n\n   Options:\n\n     -V, --version        output the version number\n     -p, --peppers        Add peppers\n     -P, --pineapple      Add pineappe\n     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce\n     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]\n     -h, --help           output usage information\n\n```\n\n## Coercion\n\n```js\nfunction range(val) {\n  return val.split('..').map(Number);\n}\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',');\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .usage('[options] <file ...>')\n  .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)\n  .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)\n  .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)\n  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)\n  .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log(' int: %j', program.integer);\nconsole.log(' float: %j', program.float);\nconsole.log(' optional: %j', program.optional);\nprogram.range = program.range || [];\nconsole.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]);\nconsole.log(' list: %j', program.list);\nconsole.log(' args: %j', program.args);\n```\n\n## Custom help\n\n You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information\n by listening for \"--help\". Commander will automatically\n exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program\n does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example\n in the following executable \"stuff\" will not output when\n `--help` is used.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('../');\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',').map(Number);\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')\n  .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')\n  .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');\n\n// must be before .parse() since\n// node's emit() is immediate\n\nprogram.on('--help', function(){\n  console.log('  Examples:');\n  console.log('');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help --help');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help -h');\n  console.log('');\n});\n\nprogram.parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('stuff');\n```\n\nyielding the following help output:\n\n```\n\nUsage: custom-help [options]\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help     output usage information\n  -V, --version  output the version number\n  -f, --foo      enable some foo\n  -b, --bar      enable some bar\n  -B, --baz      enable some baz\n\nExamples:\n\n  $ custom-help --help\n  $ custom-help -h\n\n```\n\n## .prompt(msg, fn)\n\n Single-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('name: ', function(name){\n  console.log('hi %s', name);\n});\n```\n\n Multi-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('description:', function(name){\n  console.log('hi %s', name);\n});\n```\n\n Coercion:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('Age: ', Number, function(age){\n  console.log('age: %j', age);\n});\n```\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('Birthdate: ', Date, function(date){\n  console.log('date: %s', date);\n});\n```\n\n## .password(msg[, mask], fn)\n\nPrompt for password without echoing:\n\n```js\nprogram.password('Password: ', function(pass){\n  console.log('got \"%s\"', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\nPrompt for password with mask char \"*\":\n\n```js\nprogram.password('Password: ', '*', function(pass){\n  console.log('got \"%s\"', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\n## .confirm(msg, fn)\n\n Confirm with the given `msg`:\n\n```js\nprogram.confirm('continue? ', function(ok){\n  console.log(' got %j', ok);\n});\n```\n\n## .choose(list, fn)\n\n Let the user choose from a `list`:\n\n```js\nvar list = ['tobi', 'loki', 'jane', 'manny', 'luna'];\n\nconsole.log('Choose the coolest pet:');\nprogram.choose(list, function(i){\n  console.log('you chose %d \"%s\"', i, list[i]);\n});\n```\n\n## .outputHelp()\n\n  Output help information without exiting.\n\n## .help()\n\n  Output help information and exit immediately.\n\n## Links\n\n - [API documentation](http://visionmedia.github.com/commander.js/)\n - [ascii tables](https://github.com/LearnBoost/cli-table)\n - [progress bars](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-progress)\n - [more progress bars](https://github.com/substack/node-multimeter)\n - [examples](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js/tree/master/examples)\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Device.\n2. Operation System (OS).\n3. Browser.\n4. Rendering Engine.\n\nDetected information data structure like:\n\n```javascript\ndetector = {\n    device: {\n        name: \"iphone\",\n        version: -1,\n        fullVersion: \"-1\",\n        [iphone]: -1\n    },\n    os: {\n        name: \"ios\",\n        version: 6.1,\n        fullVersion: \"6.1\",\n        [ios]: 6.1\n    },\n    browser: {\n        name: \"chrome\":\n        version: 26.0,\n        fullVersion: \"26.0.1410.50\",\n        mode: 26.0,\n        fullMode: \"26.0.1410.50\",\n        compatible: false,\n        [chrome]: 26.0\n    },\n    engine: {\n        name:

}\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: Above `[iphone]`, `[ios]`, `[chrome]`, `[webkit]` is dynamically from\nactual environment, different device, operation system, browser and rendering\nengine is different.\n\nNote:\n\n* This version of detector's code is follow CommonJS sepcification, and support\n  NodeJS and Web Browser environment at the same time.\n* Some times, you just need simple detect a litter information, please reference\n  to [#18](https://github.com/hotoo/detector/issues/18), without `detector`.\n\n## Installation\n\nvia npm:\n\nInstallation to global (with `-g` argument), you can use `detector` command in\nterminal.\n\n```\nnpm install detector [-g]\n```\n\n\nvia spm:\n\n```\nspm install detector\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSome examples in common use:\n\n```javascript\n// Detect browser name.\ndetector.browser.name === \"chrome\" // true\n\n// An other example for detect browser name.\n!!detector.browser.ie // false\n\n// Detect the old browseres.\nif(detector.browser.ie && detector.browser.version < 8){\n    alert(\"You browser is too old.\");\n}\n\n// Detect rendering engine below Trident 4 (IE8).\nif(detector.engine.trident && detector.engine.mode < 4){\n    // hack code.\n}\n\n// Collect client detail informations.\ndetector.browser.name + \"/\" + detector.browser.fullVersion;\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### {String}

You have to explicitly set a data path using\n`.setDataPath()` in these cases.\n\n**Kind**: static method of [<code>storage</code>](#module_storage)  \n**Summary**: Get the default data path  \n**Returns**: <code>String</code> \\| <code>Null</code> - default data path  \n**Access**: public  \n**Example**  \n```js\nconst defaultDataPath = storage.getDefaultDataPath()\n```\n<a name=\"module_storage.setDataPath\"></a>\n\n### storage.setDataPath(directory)\nThe default value will be used if the directory is undefined.\n\n**Kind**: static method of [<code>storage</code>](#module_storage)  \n**Summary**: Set current data path  \n**Access**: public  \n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| directory | <code>String</code> \\| <code>Undefined</code> | directory |\n\n**Example**  \n```js\nconst os = require('os');\nconst storage = require('electron-json-storage');\n\nstorage.setDataPath(os.tmpdir());\n```\n<a name=\"module_storage.getDataPath\"></a>\n\n### storage.getDataPath() ⇒ <code>String</code>\nReturns the current data path. It defaults to a directory called\n\"storage\" inside Electron's `userData` path.\n\n**Kind**: static method of [<code>storage</code>](#module_storage)  \n**Summary**: Get current user data path  \n**Returns**: <code>String</code> - the user data path  \n**Access**: public  \n**Example**  \n```js\nconst storage = require('electron-json-storage');\n\nconst dataPath = storage.getDataPath();\nconsole.log(dataPath);\n```\n<a name=\"module_storage.get\"></a>\n\n### storage.get(key, [options], callback)\nIf the key doesn't exist in the user data, an empty object is returned.\nAlso notice that the `.json` extension is added automatically, but it's\nignored if you pass it yourself.\n\nPassing an extension other than `.json` will result in a file created\nwith both extensions. For example, the key `foo.data` will result in a file\ncalled `foo.data.json`.\n\n**Kind**: static method of [<code>storage</code>](#module_storage)  \n**Summary**: Read user data  \n**Access**:

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

    "licenseText": "# GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)\n\n#### Ultra high-performance, professional-grade animation for the modern web\n\nGSAP is a JavaScript library for high-performance HTML5 animations that work in **all** major browsers. No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, API efficiency, and tight control while solving real-world problems for animators on over 3 million sites. GSAP can animate *any* numeric property of *any* JS object, not just CSS properties.\n\n### What is GSAP? (video)\n\n[![What is GSAP?](http://img.youtube.com/vi/-riXBjDfvOw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-riXBjDfvOw)\n\n### Getting started video\n\n[![Getting started video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/tMP1PCErrmE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMP1PCErrmE)\n\nThink of GSAP as the Swiss Army Knife of animation. It animates anything JavaScript can touch (CSS properties, canvas library objects, SVG, generic objects, whatever) and solves countless browser inconsistencies, all with blazing speed (up to 20x faster than jQuery), including automatic GPU-acceleration of transforms. See the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/why-gsap/\">\"Why GSAP?\"</a> article for details. Most other libraries only animate CSS properties. Plus, their sequencing abilities and runtime controls pale by comparison. Simply put, GSAP is the most robust high-performance animation library on the planet, which is probably why Google recommends it for JS-based animations and every major ad network excludes it from file size calculations. Unlike monolithic frameworks that dictate how you structure your apps, GSAP is completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want.\n\nThis is the public repository for GreenSock's JavaScript tools like <a href=\"https://greensock.com/gsap/\" target=\"_blank\">GSAP</a> and <a href=\"https://greensock.com/draggable/\" target=\"_blank\">Draggable</a>. \"GSAP\" describes all of the animation-related tools which include TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, TimelineMax, various plugins (like CSSPlugin for animating CSS properties of DOM elements), extra easing functions, etc. \n\n### Resources\n\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/gsap/\">GSAP home page</a>\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/get-started-js/\">Getting started guide</a>\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/\">Full documentation</a>\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/forums/\">Community forums</a>\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/examples-showcases\">Examples &amp; showcases</a>\n* <a href=\"https://codepen.io/GreenSock/full/OPqpRJ/\">Codepen with all bonus plugins</a> (try them for free on codepen)\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/why-gsap/\">Why GSAP?</a> (a practical guide for developers)\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/draggable/\">Draggable demo</a>\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/svg-tips/\">Animating SVG with GSAP</a>\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/club/\">Club GreenSock</a> (get access to bonus plugins and tools not in this repository)\n* css-tricks.com article: <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/myth-busting-css-animations-vs-javascript/\">Myth Busting: CSS Animations vs. JavaScript</a>\n* css-tricks.com article about how <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/svg-animation-on-css-transforms/\">GSAP solves cross-browser SVG animation challenges</a>\n\n### CDN\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/1.20.2/TweenMax.min.js\"></script>\n```\nClick the green \"Download GSAP\" button at <a href=\"https://greensock.com/?download=GSAP-JS\">https://greensock.com</a> for more options. Most ad networks have it on their CDNs as well, so contact them for the appropriate URL(s). \n\n### NPM\n```javascript\nnpm install gsap\n```\nThe default (main) file is TweenMax which also includes TweenLite, TimelineLite, TimelineMax, CSSPlugin, RoundPropsPlugin, BezierPlugin, AttrPlugin, DirectionalRotationPlugin, and all of the eases like Power1, Power2, Power3, Power4, Back, Bounce, Circ, Cubic, Elastic, Expo, Linear, Sine, RoughEase, SlowMo, and SteppedEase (except the CustomEase, CustomWiggle, and CustomBounce). Please make sure you're using at least version 1.19.1.\n```javascript\n//typical import\nimport {TweenMax, Power2, TimelineLite} from \"gsap\";\n\n//or get to the parts that aren't included inside TweenMax (works as of 1.19.1):\nimport Draggable from \"gsap/Draggable\";\nimport ScrollToPlugin from \"gsap/ScrollToPlugin\";\n```\n\n### Get CustomEase for free\nSign up for a free GreenSock account to gain access to <a href=\"https://greensock.com/customease/\">CustomEase</a>, a tool that lets you create literally any ease imaginable (unlimited control points).

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

    "version": "0.1.4",
    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "# jquery.cookie [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carhartl/jquery-cookie.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carhartl/jquery-cookie) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/carhartl/jquery-cookie.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/carhartl/jquery-cookie)\n\nA simple, lightweight jQuery plugin for reading, writing and deleting cookies.\n\n**If you're viewing this at https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie, you're reading the documentation for the master branch.\n[View documentation for the latest release (1.4.1).](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/tree/v1.4.1)**\n\n## Build Status Matrix\n\n[![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/jquery-cookie.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/jquery-cookie)\n\n## Installation\n\nInclude script *after* the jQuery library (unless you are packaging scripts somehow else):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/path/to/jquery.cookie.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Do not include the script directly from GitHub (http://raw.github.com/...).** The file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked\nin Internet Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom line: GitHub is not a CDN.\n\nThe plugin can also be loaded as AMD or CommonJS module.\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate session cookie:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('the_cookie', 'the_value');\n```\n\nCreate expiring cookie, 7 days from then:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('the_cookie', 'the_value', { expires: 7 });\n```\n\nCreate expiring cookie, valid across entire site:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('the_cookie', 'the_value', { expires: 7, path: '/' });\n```\n\nRead cookie:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('the_cookie'); // => \"the_value\"\n$.cookie('not_existing'); // => undefined\n```\n\nRead all available cookies:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie(); // => { \"the_cookie\": \"the_value\", \"...remaining\": \"cookies\" }\n```\n\nDelete cookie:\n\n```javascript\n// Returns true when cookie was found, false when no cookie was found...\n$.removeCookie('the_cookie');\n\n// Same path as when the cookie was written...\n$.removeCookie('the_cookie', { path: '/' });\n```\n\n*Note: when deleting a cookie, you must pass the exact same path, domain and secure options that were used to set the cookie, unless you're relying on the default options that is.*\n\n## Configuration\n\n### raw\n\nBy default the cookie value is encoded/decoded when writing/reading, using `encodeURIComponent`/`decodeURIComponent`. Bypass this by setting raw to true:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie.raw = true;\n```\n\n### json\n\nTurn on automatic storage of JSON objects passed as the cookie value. Assumes `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie.json = true;\n```\n\n## Cookie Options\n\nCookie attributes can be set globally by setting properties of the `$.cookie.defaults` object or individually for each call to `$.cookie()` by passing a plain object to the options argument. Per-call options override the default options.\n\n### expires\n\n    expires: 365\n\nDefine lifetime of the cookie. Value can be a `Number` which will be interpreted as days from time of creation or a `Date` object. If omitted, the cookie becomes a session cookie.\n\n### path\n\n    path: '/'\n\nDefine the path where the cookie is valid. *By default the path of the cookie is the path of the page where the cookie was created (standard browser behavior).* If you want to make it available for instance across the entire domain use `path: '/'`. Default: path of page where the cookie was created.\n\n**Note regarding Internet Explorer:**\n\n> Due to an obscure bug in the underlying WinINET InternetGetCookie implementation, IE’s document.cookie will not return a cookie if it was set with a path attribute containing a filename.\n\n(From [Internet Explorer Cookie Internals (FAQ)](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2009/08/20/wininet-ie-cookie-internals-faq.aspx))\n\nThis means one cannot set a path using `path: window.location.pathname` in case such pathname contains a filename like so: `/check.html` (or at least, such cookie cannot be read correctly).\n\n### domain\n\n    domain: 'example.com'\n\nDefine the domain where the cookie is valid. Default: domain of page where the cookie was created.\n\n### secure\n\n    secure: true\n\nIf true, the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol (https). Default: `false`.\n\n## Converters\n\nProvide a conversion function as optional last argument for reading, in order to change the cookie's value\nto a different representation on the fly.\n\nExample for parsing a value into a number:\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie('foo', '42');\n$.cookie('foo', Number); // => 42\n```\n\nDealing with cookies that have been encoded using `escape` (3rd party cookies):\n\n```javascript\n$.cookie.raw = true;\n$.cookie('foo', unescape);\n```\n\nYou can pass an arbitrary conversion function.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck out the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Authors\n\n[Klaus Hartl](https://github.com/carhartl)",

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

Some people discovered this hidden\ngem, and started using it in their own code.\n\nNow in Node `v0.8.x`, this `\"keypress\"` event does not get emitted by default,\nbut rather only when it is being used in conjuction with the `readline` (or by\nextension, the `repl`) module.\n\nThis module is the exact logic from the node `v0.8.x` releases ripped out into its\nown module.\n\n__Bonus:__ Now with mouse support!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install keypress\n```\n\nOr add it to the `\"dependencies\"` section of your _package.json_ file.\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n#### Listening for \"keypress\" events\n\n``` js\nvar keypress = require('keypress');\n\n// make `process.stdin` begin emitting \"keypress\" events\nkeypress(process.stdin);\n\n// listen for the \"keypress\" event\nprocess.stdin.on('keypress', function (ch, key) {\n  console.log('got \"keypress\"', key);\n  if (key && key.ctrl && key.name == 'c') {\n    process.stdin.pause();\n  }\n});\n\nprocess.stdin.setRawMode(true);\nprocess.stdin.resume();\n```\n\n#### Listening for \"mousepress\" events\n\n``` js\nvar keypress = require('keypress');\n\n// make `process.stdin` begin emitting \"mousepress\" (and \"keypress\") events\nkeypress(process.stdin);\n\n// you must enable the mouse events before they will begin firing\nkeypress.enableMouse(process.stdout);\n\nprocess.stdin.on('mousepress', function (info) {\n  console.log('got \"mousepress\" event at %d x %d', info.x, info.y);\n});\n\nprocess.on('exit', function () {\n  // disable mouse on exit, so that the state\n  // is back to normal for the terminal\n  keypress.disableMouse(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

If this is the first time attempting, a permissions dialog will be shown to the user. Any subsequent calls to `hasScreenCapturePermission` will just check for the permission but won't show a dialog. If the user denied the original request, you need to prompt them to enable the permissions in the System Preferences.\n\nThis can be reset by calling `resetPermissions`. The dialog will be shown again after that.\n\nReturns `true` on macOS versions older than 10.15 since this permission wasn't present\n\n#### `.hasPromptedForPermission(): boolean`\n\n**Note:** Only works for Electron apps\n\nWhether or not the permission dialog has been shown to the user. Will be `false` if you haven't called `hasScreenCapturePermission` for this app yet, and `true` otherwise.\n\nThis can be reset by calling `resetPermissions`,\n\nReturns `false` on macOS versions older than 10.15 since this permission wasn't present\n\n#### `.resetPermissions({bundleId?: string}): boolean`\n\nReset the `ScreenCapture` permissions. It will reset the permissions for **all** apps, so use with care. Provide a `bundleId` (i.e. com.apple.Terminal) to reset the permissions only for that app.\n\nCalls `tccutil reset ScreenCapture [bundleId]`.\n\nThis will revoke access if it was previously granted, and it will trigger the permissions dialog the next time `hasScreenCapturePermission` is called.\n\nReturns `true` if the command executed successfully and `false` otherwise.\n\nReturns `false` on macOS versions older than 10.15 since this permission wasn't present\n\n#### `.openSystemPreferences(): Promise<void>`\n\nOpen the System Preferences in the Screen Recording permissions section under the Security pane.\n\nOnly available in Electron apps.\n\nReturns a Promise that resolves when the window is opened\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

    "version": "0.0.0",
    "licenseText": "# node-ensure\n\nA simple library that shims asynchronous module loading into Node.js to help\nwith building module bundlers and client-side loaders for isomorphic apps.\nThis library is super slim (read the source) and mainly represents an agreement\nbetween developers and users of a particular bundler/loader.\n\nNOTE: This module is *not* compatible with Browserify. It is for developers that\nwant to split their bundles for the client. For example, see\n[dynapack](https://github.com/bauerca/dynapack).\n\n*Syntax is inspired by the CommonJS\n[Modules/Async/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/Async/A) proposal.*\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install node-ensure\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar ensure = require('node-ensure');\n\nensure(['superagent', 'react'], function(err) {\n  var request = require('superagent');\n  var React = require('react');\n\n  // Do the coolest of things.\n});\n```\n\nIf your bundler needs `require.ensure`, do this instead:\n\n```js\nrequire.ensure = require('node-ensure');\n\nrequire.ensure(['superagent', 'react'], function(err) {\n  var request = require('superagent');\n  var React = require('react');\n\n  // Do the coolest of things.\n});\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe returned function takes an array of strings and a callback, in that\norder (see the example above). The callback takes a single error argument, which\nusually indicates a network problem or other client-side loader-specific runtime\nerror (it should never receive an error when used in Node.js).\n\nWithin the ensure callback, load modules with standard require calls.\n\n## Bundlers/Loaders\n\nThis library primarily constitutes an agreement between users and developers of\nmodule bundlers and (client-side) loaders. The users agree to the usage instructions\nsupplied above.\n\nBundlers and/or loaders must adhere to the following:\n\n- The bundler/loader uses the package.json `\"browser\"` property for replacing\n  server-only modules with browser-ready counterparts (a la Browserify).\n- The `require` function passed to a module must have a `require.ensure`\n  function.\n- Each `require.ensure` must accept the same arguments as described in [Usage](#usage).\n- Each `require.ensure` must not access variables via closure unless those variables\n  are shared by **all** `require.ensure` functions.\n- Each `require.ensure` may access properties\n  on `this`. However, this assumes users have attached node-ensure to `require` via\n  `require.ensure = require('node-ensure')`.\n\nHappy loading!\n\n# License\n\nMIT",

For the purposes\r\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\r\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\r\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\r\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\r\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\r\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\r\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\r\n      the copyright owner.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\r\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\r\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\r\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\r\n\r\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\r\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\r\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\r\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\r\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\r\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\r\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\r\n      meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\r\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n          stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

    "licenseText": "React Hot API\n=========\n\nThis is a generic library implementing hot reload for React components without unmounting or losing their state.  \n\n**It is intended for build tool authors or adventurous folk and *not* for website development. For a reference implementation *that you can actually use*, check out [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) for Webpack.**\n\nThis library drives React hot-reload magic of **[react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)** but is not tied to Webpack itself, so alternative build systems that support hot-reloading individual modules can use it to implement **[live-editing for React components](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/)**. For example, you can use this to **[integrate hot reloading into an atom-shell application](https://github.com/BenoitZugmeyer/chwitt-react/blob/2d62184986c7c183955dcb607dba5ceda70a2221/bootstrap-jsx.js#L33)**. \n\n**[See the video.](https://vimeo.com/100010922)**\n\n### API\n\n#### `makeHot: (ReactClass, persistentId?) => ReactClass`\n\nRegisters a hot-reloadable React class. If you don't pass `persistentId`, it is inferred from `ReactClass.displayName` or `ReactClass.name` (for ES6 classes). When called for the first time, it will merely return the passed class. When called the next time with the same `persistentId`, will patch original class with the prototype of the new class, and return the original class.\n\n#### `require('react-hot-api'): (getRootInstances, React) => makeHot`\n\nInvoke this once within each hot-reloadable module to obtain the function described above.  \nYou must pass the result between *all emitted versions of the same module* for hot reload to work.\n\n`getRootInstances` is a method you as a caller should provide. It should return all root components on the page.\nYou can implement it by returning `require('react/lib/ReactMount')._instancesByReactRootID` but you may also want to return some known root instance, for example, if you host React Hot API on a webpage for a live editor playground.\n\n### Usage\n\nThis library is not meant to be used directly, unless you're authoring a build tool like [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader).\n\nIt only makes sense if your build tool of choice is capable of two things:\n\n* emitting next versions of the same module and evaluate them;\n* passing arbitrary JS objects from previous to the next version of the same module.\n\nI am only aware of [Webpack Hot Module Replacement](http://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html) but eventually other implementations should arise.\n\nIn which case, here's how you can tranform the source to use it:\n\n##### SomeComponent.js, first run\n\n```javascript\nvar React = require('react');\n\nvar SomeComponent = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return <p>Version 1</p>;\n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = SomeComponent;\n\n\n\n// ================================================\n// The code you might generate with your build tool\n// to hide hot reloading mechanics from user:\n\nvar makeHot = SOME_STORAGE_SHARED_BETWEEN_VERSIONS_OF_SAME_MODULE.makeHot;\nif (!makeHot) {\n  // On the first run, we will get here\n  makeHot = SOME_STORAGE_SHARED_BETWEEN_VERSIONS_OF_SAME_MODULE.makeHot = require('react-hot-api')(require('react/lib/ReactMount'));\n}\n\n// Will merely register SomeComponent so it can later be patched\nmodule.exports = makeHot(module.exports);\n```\n\n##### SomeComponent.js, subsequent runs (emitted after user edits the source)\n```javascript\nvar React = require('react');\n\nvar SomeComponent = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return <p>Version 2</p>;\n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = SomeComponent;\n\n\n\n// ================================================\n// The code you might generate with your build tool\n// to hide hot reloading mechanics from user:\n\nvar makeHot = SOME_STORAGE_SHARED_BETWEEN_VERSIONS_OF_SAME_MODULE.makeHot;\nif (!makeHot) {\n  // On the second run, we will *NOT* get here\n  makeHot = SOME_STORAGE_SHARED_BETWEEN_VERSIONS_OF_SAME_MODULE.makeHot = require('react-hot-api')(require('react/lib/ReactMount'));\n}\n\n// Will patch existing SomeComponent with updated methods, force re-rendering and return patched first version\nmodule.exports = makeHot(module.exports);\n```\n\nYou may also give user some way to access `makeHot` in case they want to allow hot-reloading for arbitrary classes inside the module:\n\n##### AnonComponents.js\n```javascript\n// The user still doesn't need to know these lines are being inserted by the tool:\nmodule.makeHot = SOME_STORAGE_SHARED_BETWEEN_VERSIONS_OF_SAME_MODULE.makeHot;\nif (!module.makeHot) {\n  // put the function into some sane place (e.g. module.makeHot) without relying on hidden variables\n  module.makeHot = SOME_STORAGE_SHARED_BETWEEN_VERSIONS_OF_SAME_MODULE.makeHot = require('react-hot-api')(require('react/lib/ReactMount'));\n}\n// You might generate the code above with your build tool\n// to hide hot reloading mechanics from user.\n// ================================================\n\n\n\nvar React = require('react');\n\nfunction createLabelComponent(str) {\n  var cls = React.createClass({\n    render: function () {\n      return <span>{str}</span>;\n    }\n  });\n  \n  // ... but you may give user freedom to do this:\n  if (module.makeHot) { // we're in development and makeHot is available\n    cls = module.makeHot(cls, str); // use parameter as unique ID for anon class\n  }\n  \n  return cls;\n}\n\n// These will be hot-reloadable:\nvar Foo = createLabelComponent('Foo');\nvar Bar = createLabelComponent('Bar');\n```\n\n### Thanks\n\n* [Tobias Koppers](https://github.com/sokra) for Webpack and HMR;\n* [Johannes Lumpe](https://github.com/johanneslumpe) and [Ben Alpert](https://github.com/spicyj) for helping me come up with the original hot reloading approach I'm still using here;\n* [Omar Skalli](https://github.com/Chetane) for coming up with an approach for forcing tree update that is compatible with ES6 classes [just the moment I needed it most](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/543174410493239297);\n* [Kyle Mathews](http://github.com/KyleAMathews) for being the first person to actually use hot loader and helping spread the word when it was in initial stages;\n* [Christopher Chedeau](https://github.com/vjeux) for retweeting my horrendously hacked together proof of concept video, overwhelming response from which gave me the incentive to actually finish this thing;\n* Bret Victor for making me think live editing should be the norm, although he probably hates what people do after watching his videos.",

    "licenseText": "# React Hot Loader [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-hot-loader.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/react-hot-loader)\n\nThis is a **stable for daily use in development** implementation of [React live code editing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw4fKkyPPg8).\n\n* Get inspired by a **[demo video](https://vimeo.com/100010922)** and **[try the live demo](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/)**.\n\n* Read **[the integration walkthrough](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/getstarted/).**\n\n* Use **[one of the starter kits](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/docs#starter-kits)** for your next React project.\n\n## The Talk\n\nReact Hot Loader was demoed together with **[Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux)** at React Europe.  \nWatch **[Dan Abramov's talk on Hot Reloading with Time Travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs).**\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader`\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you want to try hot reloading in a new project, try **[one of the starter kits](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/docs#starter-kits)**, **[React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)** being the most minimal one.\n\nTo use React Hot Loader in an existing project, you need to\n\n* switch to Webpack for builds (instead of RequireJS or Browserify);\n* enable Hot Module Replacement, which is a Webpack feature;\n* configure Webpack to use React Hot Loader for JS or JSX files.\n\nThese steps are covered by **[the walkthrough](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/getstarted/)**.\n\nIf you'd rather stay with **Browserify**, check out **[LiveReactload](https://github.com/milankinen/livereactload)** by Matti Lankinen.\n\n## Flux\n\n**[Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux)** is a Flux implementation that supports hot reloading of everything out of the box. Read **[The Evolution of Flux Frameworks](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/the-evolution-of-flux-frameworks-6c16ad26bb31)** for some context around its creation.\n\n## React Native\n\nYou can use React Hot Loader to tweak a React Native application. Check out **[react-native-webpack-server](https://github.com/mjohnston/react-native-webpack-server)** by Michael Johnston.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf something doesn't work, in 99% cases it's a configuration issue. A missing option, a wrong path or port. Webpack is very strict about configuration, and the best way to find out what's wrong is to compare your project to an already working setup, such as **[React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)**, bit by bit. We're also gathering **[Troubleshooting Recipes](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md)** so send a PR if you have a lesson to share!\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocs are in a bit of a flux right now because I'm in the process of updating everything to document the major 1.0 release.\n\nIf you just learned about React Hot Loader and want to find out more, **[check out the walkthrough](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/getstarted/)** and then try one of the **[starter kits](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/docs#starter-kits)**.\n\nIf you've been with us for a while, read **[1.0 release notes and migration guide](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/README.md#migrating-to-10)**.\n\n## Got Questions?\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/gaearon/react-hot-loader?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nWatch the repo to stay tuned!\n\n## License\n\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)",

    "repository": "https://github.com/lddubeau/saxes",
    "name": "saxes",
    "version": "5.0.1",
    "licenseText": "# saxes\n\nA sax-style non-validating parser for XML.\n\nSaxes is a fork of [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) 1.2.4. All mentions\nof sax in this project's documentation are references to sax 1.2.4.\n\nDesigned with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the\nbrowser or other CommonJS implementations.\n\nSaxes does not support Node versions older than 10.\n\n## Notable Differences from Sax.\n\n* Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML\n  well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called \"strict mode\", is not strict. It\n  silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need\n  better compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is.\n\n  Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-XML, or bad XML. Saxes\n  will report well-formedness errors in all these cases but it won't try to\n  extract data from malformed documents like sax does.\n\n* Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign\n  of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to\n  removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes\n  adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML\n  specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the\n  performance improvement.\n\n* Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms. We will not pollute the\n  source or the default build with support for antiquated platforms. If you want\n  support for IE 11, you are welcome to produce a PR that adds a *new build*\n  transpiled to ES5.\n\n* Saxes handles errors differently from sax: it provides a default onerror\n  handler which throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If\n  your handler does nothing, there is no `resume` method to call.\n\n* There's no `Stream` API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still\n  a \"streaming parser\" in the general sense that you write a character stream to\n  it.)\n\n* Saxes does not have facilities for limiting the size the data chunks passed to\n  event handlers. See the FAQ entry for more details.\n\n## Conformance\n\nSaxes supports:\n\n* [XML 1.0 fifth edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/)\n* [XML 1.1 second edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/)\n* [Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xml-names-20091208/).\n* [Namespaces in XML 1.1 (Second Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names11-20060816/).\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis is a non-validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is\nwell-formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs\nencountered. However, this parser does not thorougly parse the contents of\nDTDs. So most malformedness errors caused by errors **in DTDs** cannot be\nreported.\n\n## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE` and `<!ENTITY`\n\nThe parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute\nvalues: `&amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;`. It's possible to define additional\nentities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn't do anything with\nthat. If you want to listen to the `doctype` event, and then fetch the\ndoctypes, and read the entities and add them to `parser.ENTITIES`, then be my\nguest.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe source code contains JSDOC comments. Use them. What follows is a brief\nsummary of what is available. The final authority is the source code.\n\n**PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS PUBLIC AND WHAT IS PRIVATE.**\n\nThe move to TypeScript makes it so that everything is now formally private,\nprotected, or public.\n\nIf you use anything not public, that's at your own peril.\n\nIf there's a mistake in the documentation, raise an issue. If you just assume,\nyou may assume incorrectly.\n\n## Summary Usage Information\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\nvar saxes = require(\"./lib/saxes\"),\n  parser = new saxes.SaxesParser();\n\nparser.on(\"error\", function (e) {\n  // an error happened.\n});\nparser.on(\"text\", function (t) {\n  // got some text.  t is the string of text.\n});\nparser.on(\"opentag\", function (node) {\n  // opened a tag.  node has \"name\" and \"attributes\"\n});\nparser.on(\"end\", function () {\n  // parser stream is done, and ready to have more stuff written to it.\n});\n\nparser.write('<xml>Hello, <who name=\"world\">world</who>!</xml>').close();\n```\n\n### Constructor Arguments\n\nSettings supported:\n\n* `xmlns` - Boolean. If `true`, then namespaces are supported. Default\n  is `false`.\n\n* `position` - Boolean. If `false`, then don't track line/col/position. Unset is\n  treated as `true`. Default is unset. Currently, setting this to `false` only\n  results in a cosmetic change: the errors reported do not contain position\n  information. sax-js would literally turn off the position-computing logic if\n  this flag was set to false. The notion was that it would optimize\n  execution. In saxes at least it turns out that continually testing this flag\n  causes a cost that offsets the benefits of turning off this logic.\n\n* `fileName` - String. Set a file name for error reporting. This is useful only\n  when tracking positions. You may leave it unset.\n\n* `fragment` - Boolean. If `true`, parse the XML as an XML fragment. Default is\n  `false`.\n\n* `additionalNamespaces` - A plain object whose key, value pairs define\n   namespaces known before parsing the XML file. It is not legal to pass\n   bindings for the namespaces `\"xml\"` or `\"xmlns\"`.\n\n* `defaultXMLVersion` - The default version of the XML specification to use if\n  the document contains no XML declaration. If the document does contain an XML\n  declaration, then this setting is ignored. Must be `\"1.0\"` or `\"1.1\"`. The\n  default is `\"1.0\"`.\n\n* `forceXMLVersion` - Boolean. A flag indicating whether to force the XML\n  version used for parsing to the value of ``defaultXMLVersion``. When this flag\n  is ``true``, ``defaultXMLVersion`` must be specified. If unspecified, the\n  default value of this flag is ``false``.\n\n  Example: suppose you are parsing a document that has an XML declaration\n  specifying XML version 1.1.\n\n  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``\"1.0\"`` without setting\n  ``forceXMLVersion`` then the XML declaration will override the value of\n  ``defaultXMLVersion`` and the document will be parsed according to XML 1.1.\n\n  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``\"1.0\"`` and set ``forceXMLVersion`` to\n  ``true``, then the XML declaration will be ignored and the document will be\n  parsed according to XML 1.0.\n\n### Methods\n\n`write` - Write bytes onto the stream. You don't have to pass the whole document\nin one `write` call. You can read your source chunk by chunk and call `write`\nwith each chunk.\n\n`close` - Close the stream. Once closed, no more data may be written until it is\ndone processing the buffer, which is signaled by the `end` event.\n\n### Properties\n\nThe parser has the following properties:\n\n`line`, `column`, `columnIndex`, `position` - Indications of the position in the\nXML document where the parser currently is looking. The `columnIndex` property\ncounts columns as if indexing into a JavaScript string, whereas the `column`\nproperty counts Unicode characters.\n\n`closed` - Boolean indicating whether or not the parser can be written to.  If\nit's `true`, then wait for the `ready` event to write again.\n\n`opt` - Any options passed into the constructor.\n\n`xmlDecl` - The XML declaration for this document. It contains the fields\n`version`, `encoding` and `standalone`. They are all `undefined` before\nencountering the XML declaration. If they are undefined after the XML\ndeclaration, the corresponding value was not set by the declaration. There is no\nevent associated with the XML declaration. In a well-formed document, the XML\ndeclaration may be preceded only by an optional BOM. So by the time any event\ngenerated by the parser happens, the declaration has been processed if present\nat all. Otherwise, you have a malformed document, and as stated above, you\ncannot rely on the parser data!\n\n### Error Handling\n\nThe parser continues to parse even upon encountering errors, and does its best\nto continue reporting errors. You should heed all errors reported. After an\nerror, however, saxes may interpret your document incorrectly. For instance\n``<foo a=bc=\"d\"/>`` is invalid XML. Did you mean to have ``<foo a=\"bc=d\"/>`` or\n``<foo a=\"b\" c=\"d\"/>`` or some other variation?  For the sake of continuing to\nprovide errors, saxes will continue parsing the document, but the structure it\nreports may be incorrect. It is only after the errors are fixed in the document\nthat saxes can provide a reliable interpretation of the document.\n\nThat leaves you with two rules of thumb when using saxes:\n\n* Pay attention to the errors that saxes report. The default `onerror` handler\n  throws, so by default, you cannot miss errors.\n\n* **ONCE AN ERROR HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED, STOP RELYING ON THE EVENT HANDLERS OTHER\n  THAN `onerror`.** As explained above, when saxes runs into a well-formedness\n  problem, it makes a guess in order to continue reporting more errors. The guess\n  may be wrong.\n\n### Events\n\nTo listen to an event, override `on<eventname>`. The list of supported events\nare also in the exported `EVENTS` array.\n\nSee the JSDOC comments in the source code for a description of each supported\nevent.\n\n### Parsing XML Fragments\n\nThe XML specification does not define any method by which to parse XML\nfragments. However, there are usage scenarios in which it is desirable to parse\nfragments. In order to allow this, saxes provides three initialization options.\n\nIf you pass the option `fragment: true` to the parser constructor, the parser\nwill expect an XML fragment. It essentially starts with a parsing state\nequivalent to the one it would be in if `parser.write(\"<foo\">)` had been called\nright after initialization. In other words, it expects content which is\nacceptable inside an element. This also turns off well-formedness checks that\nare inappropriate when parsing a fragment.\n\nThe option `additionalNamespaces` allows you to define additional prefix-to-URI\nbindings known before parsing starts. You would use this over `resolvePrefix` if\nyou have at the ready a series of namespaces bindings to use.\n\nThe option `resolvePrefix` allows you to pass a function which saxes will use if\nit is unable to resolve a namespace prefix by itself. You would use this over\n`additionalNamespaces` in a context where getting a complete list of defined\nnamespaces is onerous.\n\nNote that you can use `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` together if you\nwant. `additionalNamespaces` applies before `resolvePrefix`.\n\nThe options `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are really meant to be\nused for parsing fragments. However, saxes won't prevent you from using them\nwith `fragment: false`. Note that if you do this, your document may parse\nwithout errors and yet be malformed because the document can refer to namespaces\nwhich are not defined *in* the document.\n\nOf course, `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are used only if `xmlns`\nis `true`. If you are parsing a fragment that does not use namespaces, there's\nno point in setting these options.\n\n### Performance Tips\n\n* saxes works faster on files that use newlines (``\\u000A``) as end of line\n  markers than files that use other end of line markers (like ``\\r`` or\n  ``\\r\\n``). The XML specification requires that conformant applications behave\n  as if all characters that are to be treated as end of line characters are\n  converted to ``\\u000A`` prior to parsing. The optimal code path for saxes is a\n  file in which all end of line characters are already ``\\u000A``.\n\n* Don't split Unicode strings you feed to saxes across surrogates. When you\n  naively split a string in JavaScript, you run the risk of splitting a Unicode\n  character into two surrogates. e.g.  In the following example ``a`` and ``b``\n  each contain half of a single Unicode character: ``const a = \"\\u{1F4A9}\"[0];\n  const b = \"\\u{1F4A9}\"[1]`` If you feed such split surrogates to versions of\n  saxes prior to 4, you'd get errors. Saxes version 4 and over are able to\n  detect when a chunk of data ends with a surrogate and carry over the surrogate\n  to the next chunk. However this operation entails slicing and concatenating\n  strings. If you can feed your data in a way that does not split surrogates,\n  you should do it. (Obviously, feeding all the data at once with a single write\n  is fastest.)\n\n* Don't set event handlers you don't need. Saxes has always aimed to avoid doing\n  work that will just be tossed away but future improvements hope to do this\n  more aggressively. One way saxes knows whether or not some data is needed is\n  by checking whether a handler has been set for a specific event.\n\n## FAQ\n\nQ. Why has saxes dropped support for limiting the size of data chunks passed to\nevent handlers?\n\nA. With sax you could set ``MAX_BUFFER_LENGTH`` to cause the parser to limit the\nsize of data chunks passed to event handlers. So if you ran into a span of text\nabove the limit, multiple ``text`` events with smaller data chunks were fired\ninstead of a single event with a large chunk.\n\nHowever, that functionality had some problematic characteristics. It had an\narbitrary default value. It was library-wide so all parsers created from a\nsingle instance of the ``sax`` library shared it. This could potentially cause\nconflicts among libraries running in the same VM but using sax for different\npurposes.\n\nThese issues could have been easily fixed, but there were larger issues. The\nbuffer limit arbitrarily applied to some events but not others. It would split\n``text``, ``cdata`` and ``script`` events. However, if a ``comment``,\n``doctype``, ``attribute`` or ``processing instruction`` were more than the\nlimit, the parser would generate an error and you were left picking up the\npieces.\n\nIt was not intuitive to use. You'd think setting the limit to 1K would prevent\nchunks bigger than 1K to be passed to event handlers. But that was not the\ncase. A comment in the source code told you that you might go over the limit if\nyou passed large chunks to ``write``. So if you want a 1K limit, don't pass 64K\nchunks to ``write``. Fair enough. You know what limit you want so you can\ncontrol the size of the data you pass to ``write``. So you limit the chunks to\n``write`` to 1K at a time. Even if you do this, your event handlers may get data\nchunks that are 2K in size. Suppose on the previous ``write`` the parser has\njust finished processing an open tag, so it is ready for text. Your ``write``\npasses 1K of text. You are not above the limit yet, so no event is generated\nyet. The next ``write`` passes another 1K of text. It so happens that sax checks\nbuffer limits only once per ``write``, after the chunk of data has been\nprocessed. Now you've hit the limit and you get a ``text`` event with 2K of\ndata. So even if you limit your ``write`` calls to the buffer limit you've set,\nyou may still get events with chunks at twice the buffer size limit you've\nspecified.\n\nWe may consider reinstating an equivalent functionality, provided that it\naddresses the issues above and does not cause a huge performance drop for\nuse-case scenarios that don't need it.",

According to the spec, source maps have the\nfollowing attributes:\n\n* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.\n\n* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.\n\n* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual\n  mappings.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.\n\n* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.\n\n* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.\n\n* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()\n\nCompute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is\ninclusive.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)\n\nReturns the original source, line, and column information for the generated\nsource's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source.\n\n* `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest\n  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,\n  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not\n  available.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is\n  not available.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this\n  information is not available.\n\n* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns the generated line and column information for the original source,\nline, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,\nand column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings\ncorresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line\nthat has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the\ngiven line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column\nthat has any offsets.\n\nThe only argument is an object with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.\n\nand an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()\n\nReturn true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in\nthe source map, false otherwise.\n\nIn other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)`\nwill succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])\n\nReturns the original source content for the source provided. The only\nargument is the URL of the original source file.\n\nIf the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is\nthrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned\ninstead.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)\n\nIterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a\ngenerated line/column in this source map.\n\n* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the\n  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,\n  name }`\n\n* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`\n  every time that `callback` is called.\n\n* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over\n  the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the\n  original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.\n\n### SourceMapGenerator\n\nAn instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being\nbuilt incrementally.\n\n#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])\n\nYou may pass an object with the following properties:\n\n* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is\n  associated with.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.\n\n* `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as\n  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with\n  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when\n  running tests, if possible.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)\n\nAdd a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated\nsource's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object\nshould have the following properties:\n\n* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.\n\n* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.\n\n* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).\n\n* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for an original source file.\n\n* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.\n\n* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])\n\nApplies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.\nEach mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the\nsupplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings\nis the minimium of this map and the supplied map.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.\n\n* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.\n  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.\n  Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\n* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap\n  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same\n  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source\n  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten\n  relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,\n  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()\n\nRenders the source map being generated to a string.\n\n### SourceNode\n\nSourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating\nsnippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and\ncolumn information associated between those snippets and the original source\ncode. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might\nuse before outputting the generated JS and source map.\n\n#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])\n\n* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if\n  it isn't associated with an original line.\n\n* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null\n  if it isn't associated with an original column.\n\n* `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.\n\n* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see\n  below.\n\n* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.\n\n#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])\n\nCreates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.\n\n* `code`: The generated code\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code\n\n* `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`\n  should be relative to.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)\n\nAdd a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)\n\nPrepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for a source file. This will be added to the\n`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.\n\n* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file\n\n* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking\nfunction is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and\nthe its original associated source's line/column location.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each\nsource file content and is passed the filename and source content.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)\n\nLike `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator\nbetween each of this source node's children.\n\n* `sep`: The separator.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)\n\nCall `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful\nfor trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.\n\n* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.\n\n* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()\n\nReturn the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and\nconcatenates all the various snippets together to one string.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])\n\nReturns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a\nSourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and\noriginal sources.\n\nThe arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)\n\nInstall NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.\n\nTo add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js`\nand export your test functions with names that start with \"test\", for example\n\n```js\nexports[\"test doing the foo bar\"] = function (assert, util) {\n  ...\n};\n```\n\nThe new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.\n\nThe `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.\n\nThe `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have\naccess to the following assertion functions:\n\n* `doesNotThrow`\n\n* `equal`\n\n* `ok`\n\n* `strictEqual`\n\n* `throws`\n\n(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the\ntests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is\nshimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)\n\n[format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n[feature]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap\n[Dryice]: https://github.com/mozilla/dryice",

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

You can help by suggesting some of them to the [TypeScript project](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nEither add this package as a dependency or copy-paste the needed types. No credit required. 👌\n\nPR welcome for additional commonly needed types and docs improvements.

If you think this type is useful, provide some real-world use-cases and we might reconsider.\n- [`Dictionary`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/issues/33) - You only save a few characters (`Dictionary<number>` vs `Record<string, number>`) from [`Record`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type), which is more flexible and well-known. Also, you shouldn't use an object as a dictionary. We have `Map` in JavaScript now.\n- [`ExtractProperties` and `ExtractMethods`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/4) - The types violate the single responsibility principle. Instead, refine your types into more granular type hierarchies.\n- [`Url2Json`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/262) - Inferring search parameters from a URL string is a cute idea, but not very useful in practice, since search parameters are usually dynamic and defined separately.\n- [`Nullish`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/318) - The type only saves a couple of characters, not everyone knows what \"nullish\" means, and I'm also trying to [get away from `null`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meta/discussions/7).\n- [`TitleCase`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/303) - It's not solving a common need and is a better fit for a separate package.\n- [`ExtendOr` and `ExtendAnd`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/247) - The benefits don't outweigh having to learn what they mean.\n- [`PackageJsonExtras`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/issues/371) - There are too many possible configurations that can be put into `package.json`. If you would like to extend `PackageJson` to support an additional configuration in your project, please see the *Extending existing types* section below.\n\n## Alternative type names\n\n*If you know one of our types by a different name, add it here for discovery.*\n\n- `PartialBy` - See [`SetOptional`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/set-optional.d.ts)\n- `RecordDeep`- See [`Schema`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/schema.d.ts)\n\n## Tips\n\n### Extending existing types\n\n- [`PackageJson`](source/package-json.d.ts) - There are a lot of tools that place extra configurations inside the `package.json` file. You can extend `PackageJson` to support these additional configurations.\n\t<details>\n\t<summary>\n\t\t\tExample\n\t</summary>\n\n\t[Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBDAnmApnA3gBQIYGMDW2A5igFIDOEAdnNuXAEJ0o4HFmVUC+cAZlBBBwA5ElQBaXinIxhAbgCwAKFCRYCZGnQAZYFRgooPfoJHSANntmKlysWlaESFanAC8jZo-YuaAMgwLKwBhal5gIgB+AC44XX1DADpQqnCiLhsgA)\n\n\t```ts\n\timport type {PackageJson as BasePackageJson} from 'type-fest';\n\timport type {Linter} from 'eslint';\n\n\ttype PackageJson = BasePackageJson & {eslintConfig?: Linter.Config};\n\t```\n\t</details>\n\n### Related\n\n- [typed-query-selector](https://github.com/g-plane/typed-query-selector) - Enhances `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll` with a template literal type that matches element types returned from an HTML element query selector.\n- [`Linter.Config`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/eslint/index.d.ts) - Definitions for the [ESLint configuration schema](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options).\n\n### Built-in types\n\nThere are many advanced types most users don't know about.\n\n- [`Partial<T>`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype) - Make all properties in `T` optional.\n\t<details>\n\t<summary>\n\t\t\tExample\n\t</summary>\n\n\t[Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#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)\n\n\t```ts\n\tinterface NodeConfig {\n\t\t\tappName: string;\n\t\t\tport: number;\n\t}\n\n\tclass NodeAppBuilder {\n\t\t\tprivate configuration: NodeConfig = {\n\t\t\t\t\tappName: 'NodeApp',\n\t\t\t\t\tport: 3000\n\t\t\t};\n\n\t\t\tprivate updateConfig<Key extends keyof NodeConfig>(key: Key, value: NodeConfig[Key]) {\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.configuration[key] = value;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tconfig(config: Partial<NodeConfig>) {\n\t\t\t\t\ttype NodeConfigKey = keyof NodeConfig;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tfor (const key of Object.keys(config) as NodeConfigKey[]) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconst updateValue = config[key];\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (updateValue === undefined) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.updateConfig(key, updateValue);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\treturn this;\n\t\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// `Partial<NodeConfig>`` allows us to provide only a part of the\n\t// NodeConfig interface.\n\tnew NodeAppBuilder().config({appName: 'ToDoApp'});\n\t```\n\t</details>\n\n- [`Required<T>`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#requiredtype) - Make all properties in `T` required.\n\t<details>\n\t<summary>\n\t\t\tExample\n\t</summary>\n\n\t[Playground](https://typescript-play.js.org/?target=6#code/AQ4SwOwFwUwJwGYEMDGNgGED21VQGJZwC2wA3gFCjXAzFJgA2A-AFzADOUckA5gNxUaIYjA4ckvGG07c+g6gF8KQkAgCuEFFDA5O6gEbEwUbLm2ESwABQIixACJIoSdgCUYAR3Vg4MACYAPGYuFvYAfACU5Ko0APRxwADKMBD+wFAAFuh2Vv7OSBlYGdmc8ABu8LHKsRyGxqY4oQT21pTCIHQMjOwA5DAAHgACxAAOjDAAdChYxL0ANLHUouKSMH0AEmAAhJhY6ozpAJ77GTCMjMCiV0ToSAb7UJPPC9WRgrEJwAAqR6MwSRQPFGUFocDgRHYxnEfGAowh-zgUCOwF6KwkUl6tXqJhCeEsxDaS1AXSYfUGI3GUxmc0WSneQA)\n\n\t```ts\n\tinterface ContactForm {\n\t\t\temail?: string;\n\t\t\tmessage?: string;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction submitContactForm(formData: Required<ContactForm>) {\n\t\t\t// Send the form data to the server.\n\t}\n\n\tsubmitContactForm({\n\t\t\temail: 'ex@mple.com',\n\t\t\tmessage: 'Hi!

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

The UglifyJS plugin provided with webpack runs sequentially on each of the output files.  This plugin runs uglify in parallel with one thread for each of your available cpus.  This can lead to significantly reduced build times as minification is very CPU intensive.\n\n## Config\n\nConfiguring is straightforward.\n\n```javascript\nimport ParallelUglifyPlugin from 'webpack-parallel-uglify-plugin';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    new ParallelUglifyPlugin({\n      cacheDir, // Optional absolute path to use as a cache. If not provided, caching will not be used.\n      workerCount, // Optional int. Number of workers to run uglify. Defaults to num of cpus - 1 or asset count (whichever is smaller)\n      uglifyJS: {\n        // These pass straight through to uglify.\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### Example Timings\n\nThese times were found by running webpack on a very large build, producing 493 output files and totaling 144.24 MiB before minifying.  All times are listed with fully cached babel-loader for consistency.\n\n```\nNo minification: Webpack build complete in: 86890ms (1m 26s)\nBuilt in uglify plugin: Webpack build complete in: 2543548ms (42m 23s)\nWith parallel plugin: Webpack build complete in: 208671ms (3m 28s)\nWith parallel/cache: Webpack build complete in: 98524ms (1m 38s)\n```",

A `Source` can be asked for source code, size, source map and hash.\n\n## `Source`\n\nBase class for all sources.\n\n### Public methods\n\nAll methods should be considered as expensive as they may need to do computations.\n\n#### `source`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.source() -> String\n```\n\nReturns the represented source code as string.\n\n#### `size`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.size() -> Number\n```\n\nReturns the size in chars of the represented source code.\n\n#### `map`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.map(options: Object) -> Object | null\n```\n\nReturns the SourceMap of the represented source code as JSON. May return `null` if no SourceMap is available.\n\nThe `options` object can contain the following keys:\n\n* `columns: Boolean` (default `true`): If set to false the implementation may omit mappings for columns.\n* `module: Boolean` (default `true`): If set to false the implementation may omit inner mappings for modules.\n\n#### `sourceAndMap`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.sourceAndMap(options: Object) -> {\n\tcode: String,\n\tmap: Object\n}\n```\n\nReturns both, source code (like `Source.prototype.source()` and SourceMap (like `Source.prototype.map()`). This method could have better performance than calling `source()` and `map()` separatly.\n\nSee `map()` for `options`.\n\n#### `updateHash`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.updateHash(hash: Hash) -> void\n```\n\nUpdates the provided `Hash` object with the content of the represented source code. (`Hash` is an object with an `update` method, which is called with string values)\n\n#### `node` (optional)\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.node(options: Object) -> SourceNode\n```\n\nThis is an optional method. It may be `null` if not implemented.\n\nReturns a `SourceNode` (see source-map library) for the represented source code.\n\nSee `map()` for `options`.\n\n#### `listNode` (optional)\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.listNode(options: Object) -> SourceNode\n```\n\nThis is an optional method. It may be `null` if not implemented.\n\nReturns a `SourceListMap` (see source-list-map library) for the represented source code.\n\nSee `map()` for `options`.\n\n## `RawSource`\n\nRepresents source code without SourceMap.\n\n``` js\nnew RawSource(sourceCode: String)\n```\n\n## `OriginalSource`\n\nRepresents source code, which is a copy of the original file.\n\n``` js\nnew OriginalSource(\n\tsourceCode: String,\n\tname: String\n)\n```\n\n* `sourceCode`: The source code.\n* `name`: The filename of the original source code.\n\nOriginalSource tries to create column mappings if requested, by splitting the source code at typical statement borders (`;`, `{`, `}`).\n\n## `SourceMapSource`\n\nRepresents source code with SourceMap, optionally having an additional SourceMap for the original source.\n\n``` js\nnew SourceMapSource(\n\tsourceCode: String,\n\tname: String,\n\tsourceMap: Object | String,\n\toriginalSource?: String,\n\tinnerSourceMap?: Object | String\n)\n```\n\n* `sourceCode`: The source code.\n* `name`: The filename of the original source code.\n* `sourceMap`: The SourceMap for the source code.\n* `originalSource`: The source code of the original file. Can be omitted if the `sourceMap` already contains the original source code.\n* `innerSourceMap`: The SourceMap for the `originalSource`/`name`.\n\n## `LineToLineMappedSource`\n\nRepresents source code, which is mapped line by line to the orginal file.\n\n``` js\nnew LineToLineMappedSource(\n\tsourceCode: String,\n\tname: String,\n\toriginalSource: String\n)\n```\n\n* `sourceCode`: The source code.\n* `name`: The filename of the original source code.\n* `originalSource`: The original source code.\n\n## `CachedSource`\n\nDecorates a `Source` and caches returned results of `map`, `source`, `size` and `sourceAndMap` in memory. Every other operation is delegated to the wrapped `Source`.\n\n``` js\nnew CachedSource(source: Source)\n```\n\n## `PrefixSource`\n\nPrefix every line of the decorated `Source` with a provided string.\n\n``` js\nnew PrefixSource(\n\tprefix: String,\n\tsource: Source\n)\n```\n\n## `ConcatSource`\n\nConcatenate mulitple `Source`s or strings to a single source.\n\n``` js\nnew ConcatSource(\n\t...items?: Source | String\n)\n```\n\n### Public methods\n\n#### `add`\n\n``` js\nConcatSource.prototype.add(item: Source | String)\n```\n\nAdds an item to the source.\t\n\n## `ReplaceSource`\n\nDecorates a `Source` with replacements and insertions of source code.\n\n### Public methods\n\n#### `replace`\n\n``` js\nReplaceSource.prototype.replace(\n\tstart: Number,\n\tend: Number,\n\treplacement: String\n)\n```\n\nReplaces chars from `start` (0-indexed, inclusive) to `end` (0-indexed, inclusive) with `replacement`.\n\nLocations represents locations in the original source and are not influenced by other replacements or insertions.\n\n#### `insert`\n\n``` js\nReplaceSource.prototype.insert(\n\tpos: Number,\n\tinsertion: String\n)\n```\n\nInserts the `insertion` before char `pos` (0-indexed).\n\nLocation represents location in the original source and is not influenced by other replacements or insertions.",

You can view the API documentation [online](http://fresc81.github.io/node-winreg \"online documentation\"), download the latest documentation or generate it from the sourcecode.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Online Documentation ###\r\n\r\nView the latest docs [online](http://fresc81.github.io/node-winreg \"online documentation\").\r\n\r\n\r\n### Download Documentation ###\r\n\r\nTo download the latest docs from GIT the following command is used.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpm run-script download-docs\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Generate Documentation ###\r\n\r\nTo generate the docs from the sources you can use the following command.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpm run-script generate-docs\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that generating the docs requires the development dependencies to be installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example Usage ##\r\n\r\nLet's start with an example. The code below lists the autostart programs of the current user.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Registry = require('winreg')\r\n,   regKey = new Registry({                                       // new operator is optional\r\n      hive: Registry.HKCU,                                        // open registry hive HKEY_CURRENT_USER\r\n      key:  '\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run' // key containing autostart programs\r\n    })\r\n\r\n// list autostart programs\r\nregKey.values(function (err, items /* array of RegistryItem */) {\r\n  if (err)\r\n    console.log('ERROR: '+err);\r\n  else\r\n    for (var i=0; i<items.length; i++)\r\n      console.log('ITEM: '+items[i].name+'\\t'+items[i].type+'\\t'+items[i].value);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting ##\r\n\r\n\r\n### Access to restricted keys ###\r\n\r\nSince Windows Vista access to certain Registry Hives (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or short HKLM for example) is restricted to processes that run in a security elevated context even if the user that starts the process is an admin. You can start a console within that context by right clicking the console shortcut and selecting the item with the shield icon called \"Run as administrator\" from the context menu.\r\n\r\nUnder some rare circumstances access to Registry Hives or particular keys may also be blocked by some antivirus programs or the Windows Group Policy Editor (google for gpedit.msc).\r\n\r\nYou can also use the regedit.exe tool shipped with Windows to check if you actually have access.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Processing UTF-8 data ###\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft Windows console isn't capable of handling UTF-8 encoded text unless you set it up properly. If you see weird question marks for certain characters, it's probhably a problem with the encoding.\r\n\r\nBy default the console is setup to use an encoding that suits the language of the Windows operating system installation. Windows uses codepages to specify encodings for the console. The codepage is a unique number which is assigned to each encoding.\r\n\r\nIf you want to query the currently selected codepage you can type the command <code>chcp</code> (w/o parameters). To set a new codepage (UTF-8 for this example) you pass the codepage number as the only argument to <code>chcp</code>. The codepage value for UTF-8 is 65001.\r\n\r\nYou can easily do this from within your nodejs script by using the <code>child_process.execSync(...)</code> function like the following example shows.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar execSync = require('child_process').execSync;\r\nconsole.log(execSync('chcp').toString());\r\nconsole.log(execSync('chcp 65001').toString());\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn even better approach would be to extract and store the value returned by a call to <code>chcp</code> prior setting the console to UTF-8 and resetting the codepage after your script is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nThis project is released under [BSD 2-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016, Paul Bottin All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\"\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",
